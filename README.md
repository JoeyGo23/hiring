About Packback
--------------

Packback is a quickly growing, funded ed-tech startup disrupting an $8 billion
textbook industry by changing the way students find, buy, and interact with
their educational materials. With some of Chicago’s best behind us as investors,
including Mark Cuban (owner Dallas Mavs), Mark Achler (Former SVP Redbox), and
Howard Tullman (CEO 1871), and an experienced product team, Packback is set to
be the next big thing in educational technology.

We are 3 months fresh out of a successful version 2.0 launch of our textbook rental
platform, have closed a second round of funding backed by some of Chicago's
best investors, and we’re growing and scaling faster than ever. Now we need
a few more key team members to join us in our office in scenic downtown Chicago,
where you'll be helping the Packback team redefine the college textbook industry.
