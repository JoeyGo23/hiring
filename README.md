About Packback
--------------

Packback is a quickly growing, funded ed-tech startup disrupting a multi-billion dollar textbook industry with some of Chicago’s best behind us as investors, including Mark Cuban (owner Dallas Mavs), Mark Achler (Former SVP Redbox), and Howard Tullman (CEO 1871), among others.

We are 6 months fresh out of a successful public launch, have closed a seed round of funding backed by powerful Chicago investors, and are on the heels of our airing on the ABC hit TV show “Shark Tank”.  We’re growing and scaling faster than ever, and are looking for team members to join us in our office in scenic downtown Chicago, where you'll be helping the Packback team redefine the college textbook industry.

Our technology
--------------

With publisher contracts, rights to 21 textbooks, a small team, and an MVP built on the Magento Community Edition ecommerce platform, Packback launched a pilot of this offering in August 2013.

We are sunsetting the Magento application, building new projects for each business function, and embracing the frameworks, tools and best-practices that help us get the job done well. **We want your help.**

*Relocation assistance available to qualified candidates*
