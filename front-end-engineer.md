Front End Engineer at Packback
--------------

This tour of duty will primarily see you leading a project of translating the markup and styles of our current MVP to a responsive, optimized project. Beyond that, we hope that you will continue to identify opportunities for improvement within our projects and process, as well as promote the technical best practices and techniques that you learn along the way.
 
There are plenty of technical acronyms in here, but fundamentally we’re looking for an intelligent person who possess an eagerness to learn new things, and the communication skills to be able to engage with non-engineering humans on rest of our team.
 
As well as the technical knowledge, we need a person that gets it - a person who can figure things out for themselves but knows when to yell for help without hesitation.
 
You should probably know about…

- Working closely with backend engineers and UX designers
- Semantically marked up HTML
- CSS, including SASS
- Responsive presentation frameworks such as Foundation or Bootstrap
- JavaScript frameworks & libraries such as AngularJS or Backbone.js
- JavaScript unit testing tools
- BDD best practices
- Build and automation tools such as Bower, NPM, gulp
- Git
- Running a LAMP environment locally
 
We also like talking to people who enjoy…

- Architecting and developing complex JavaScript-powered applications
- Development & consumption of HTTP APIs
- Google Apps & APIs
