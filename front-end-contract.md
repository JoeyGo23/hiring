We are looking for a front-end engineer to join our team for a short engagement to help kick-off a project. The project will last approximately two months and will focus solely on ensuring high fidelity comps are converted into semantic markup and Sass styles using the Foundation framework, NPM, Bower, and Gulp.

The project architecture is complete and we are looking for your eye for detail to help transform the designs into modularized markup.
